Sweet vengeance for Discord

v3ngeance is a raid client for Discord. It is used to load self-bots into a target guild and perform a raid based on the set configuration.

It is recommended to have at least 10-20 (30+ for maximum impact) user tokens for a successful raid.

#### How do I create accounts for raids?

An easy way to create accounts and verify them is using temporary or "fake" email address online services.

Most email websites (such as Outlook) allow "email aliases" which are separate email addresses connected to one account. This aliases
can be easily created without the need for verification. You can then use this email addresses to verify your raid accounts.

#### Wouldn't I just get IP banned quickly?

The "preparation" stage is designed to first join all nodes into the target guild in a non-alarming manner before launching the attack.

#### Am I going to get banned?

As long as you're smart, you'll be just fine. Discord does not have a way to track down your main account, nor they care about it.

One posibility of being tracked is by using your IP address, but that's highly unlikely.

If you wish to stay safe eitherway, just use a VPN or a proxy when launching attacks.

#### Why?

Mostly because I can, but also because some people just deserve it.
